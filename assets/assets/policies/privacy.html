<p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
<p>We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain Personal Data about you for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We retain your profile information, credentials, and User Data for as long as you have an account with us.</li>
    <li>We retain your payment data for as long as we need to process your purchase or subscription.</li>
    <li>We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively and efficiently.</li>
